            <p>Once i was just a kid i remember the best part of my day was dissemble toy and try to assemble.<br />
            Obivious the most time it doesn't work, and my mom dosen't like to, but once upon this time a part of me get in love with Technology,<br />
            Then i started learn how to build robots and programing, with so much difficult cause i was just a kid but never forgeting the felling of when the project finally works.</p>
